Capstone Proposal


Using Supervised Learning to predict whether a
Patient has a liver disease or not.

Project: Capstone Project

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy Pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Data: This data set contains total of 583 rows and 11 columns. Target variable ‘Dataset’ is whether the patient has the liver cancer or not. It contains 416 patients with liver disease and 167 patients with non-liver disease. Here, we are trying to predict whether the patient has the liver disease or not. Dataset has been extracted from Kaggle.

Features
Age: Age of the patient, Gender: Gender of the patient, Total Bilirubin: levels of Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin: levels of Direct Bilirubin , Alkaline: levels of Alkaline, Phosphotase: levels of Phosphotase, Alamine Aminotransferase: levels of Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase: levels of Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Proteins: level of Total Proteins, Albumin: levels of Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio: Ratio of  Albumin and Globulin

Target Variable
Dataset: Whether the patient actually has the liver cancer or not (1 – No, 2 – Yes).
